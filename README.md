LEFT TODO
--------------

- End quiz when out of questions - Partial - still need to process kill/end
- Cases for server to use kill switch on Client
- Mostly **GUI**
- Show correct answer not just if correct or not to all clients
  - IMPLMENTATION: queueSendMessage("correct answer$<id>"
  - NOTE CLIENT MUST DO: message.split(//$)[1]

alt idea for ip:port TCP not binding
serverSocket.setReuseAddress(true);
setReuseAddress(true) is the important bit, idk what our socket would be called



Doc says with no context:
(You would need to figure out a way so that server doesnâ€™t get stuck in a deadlock or an infinite wait.)
so will note it maybe just do a sweep of code after
